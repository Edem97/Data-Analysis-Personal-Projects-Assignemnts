# Data-Analysis-Personal-Projects-Assignments
## By Edem Doe Honu
This is a personal repository to practise my data analysis projects by Udacity.
The two projects in the repository currently are Enconding practice and Polishing Plot practice.
## Encoding Practice.
In the encoding practise, I get conversant with non-positional encoding for three variable-exploration.
I practised encoding via shape, size, and colour to visualize three variables.
## Polishing Plot Practice.
In order to communicate data and tell a cogent story to a larger audience, visulaizations should be well revamped to serve that purpose.
Therefore, in Polishing Plot Practice, I explore possible ways I can make my visualizations look better by for instance:
1. Using the right figure size.
2. Using the appropriate plot to communicate a data.
3. Avoiding over plotting( chart junk).
4. Maintaining the design integrity and the right data to ink ratio.
